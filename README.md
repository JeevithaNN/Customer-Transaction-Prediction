This project aims to predict whether a customer will make a transaction based on historical customer data using Machine Learning classification algorithms. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation to identify patterns in customer behavior. Various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and other algorithms are implemented and compared to achieve optimal prediction accuracy. The final model effectively predicts customer transaction behavior and provides insights into purchase trends, enabling businesses to improve targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer segmentation, and support data-driven financial decision-making.
